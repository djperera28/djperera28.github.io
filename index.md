# Hello World 

This is my home page! My name is David Perera and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

## Computer Science Projects

My GitHub page is https://github.com/djperera28.

## CPSC 120

* Lab 03

Lab 3 was fun to mess around with, making unit prices about pizza and how much it costs for the certain sizes of pizza.
Also using math terms like radius and diameter in code was so fun to implement. Tying in both computer knowledge and math
knowledge really made this lab fun.

* Lab 04

Lab 4 was very intersting with the fact that my partner and I learned how to convert measurements into other measurements.
Converting teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups and figuring out how much of one unit equals another unit.

* Lab 10

For Lab 10 my partner and I had fun discovering if specific numbers are prime numbers or not, and how we coded to see if
it was possible for large number to be prime numbers like for example, (3,137) is a prime number or not. This lab was
pretty tough with all the numbers and math that went into it but overall was a good lab learning about the square root'
integer number in code.

## CPSC 121
* Food Tracker
As a final project we made a food tracker to track the amount of food waste in my household.

## SIDE PROJECTS

* Popsmon (Terminal Based RPG Game)
https://github.com/djperera28/Legend_of_Popselion

* Refresher Course
https://github.com/csuf-cpp-refresher-fa2026/project-djperera28
We delved into object oriented programming, and made app trackers that utilize maps, and classes, to track the amount of time and usage on a particular app.
As a side final project for this I made a text based rpg game, where you encounter random enemys and defeat them to level up and gain more stats.
